R - Flight Delays analysis project

• Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the data to identify the causes of flight delays
• Help airport security to understand the effect of weather conditions and other factors on flight delays

Problem Statement
Airport arrival performance and other events are affected by weather, which may 
result in delays or capacity constraints. Almost half of all airport traffic delays are 
caused by adverse weather conditions. These uncertainties during airport 
operations can result in significant delays and inconvenience to passengers. 
Therefore, the airport authority wants to analyze the flights that are delayed and 
the effect of weather on the delays. 
You have been assigned to visualize the data with the help of histograms, scatter 
plots, box plots, and pie charts and understand the effect of weather conditions 
and other factors on flight delays.


Perform the following tasks on the dataset provided using R
1. Exploratory data analysis:
• Read the dataset
• Read the dataset description
• Understand the data
• Find out the null values
2. Install the required packages
3. Understand the summary of descriptive statistics
4. Plot the histograms to understand the relationships between scheduled time, 
carrier, destination, origin, weather, and day of the week
5. Plot the scatter plot for flights on time and delayed
Perform the following tasks on the dataset provided using R:
6. Plot the box plot to understand how many days in a month flights are delayed 
by what time
7. Define the hours of departure
8. Create a categorical representation of data using a table
9. Redefine the delay variables
10. Understand the summary of major variables
11. Plot histograms of major variables
12. Plot a pie chart to see how many flights were delayed
